## 🔁 Replication Guide

To replicate the grading of a test student submission:
## IMPORTANT NOTE: Actual student documents required for replication are confidential and access must be requested from supervisor

1. Place a sample `.docx` file in a folder called `Lab 2`.
2. Place the file `Lab2_prompt.txt` in the same folder.
3. Launch the application and select:
   - Input folder: `Lab 2`
   - Output folder: Any empty directory
4. Click **Process**.
5. After 5–10 seconds, a feedback PDF should appear in the output folder - confirmation of successful pdf will be displayed on the GUI log.

📌 Make sure to add your OpenAI and Dropbox API keys in `src/config.json` as shown in the template.

📎 All generated feedback can be viewed in the GUI log panel or PDF output file.
