General Instructions:
"Evaluate the attached lab report using the rubric provided below. 
Grade each section independently, then provide an overall score as a percentage. 
Additionally, give detailed feedback for each section, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and specific suggestions 
for improvement.

Grading Rubric:
Introduction (10%)

Does the section clearly introduce the lab's scope and objectives?
Does it discuss what each student knew about exploratory and manual functional testing before the lab?
Does it provide sufficient detail to set the stage for the lab?
Key Considerations: The section should not be overly brief and must include all necessary context for the lab.
Exploratory Testing Plan (20%)

Are the plans detailed and aligned with the lab's template instructions, specifically including:
Functions (use cases) to be tested.
Approach to testing (test many functions lightly or a few functions extensively).
Test case design (common paths, exceptional/invalid paths).
Are the test plans logically structured and comprehensive?
Key Considerations: Lack of adherence to the required template should impact the score.
Defect Reporting and Statistics (20%)

Does the report accurately categorize and list defects by type (e.g., exploratory, regression)?
Are the defect titles informative, and do they include clear reproduction steps as specified in the lab instructions?
Key Considerations: Incomplete or vague titles and unclear reproduction steps should reduce the score.
Comparison of Testing Approaches (20%)

Does it provide a balanced and detailed discussion of exploratory versus manual scripted testing?
Does it include explicit examples from lab work to support the analysis of benefits, drawbacks, trade-offs, effectiveness, and efficiency?
Key Considerations: Lack of examples or shallow comparisons should impact the score.
Peer Reviews and Teamwork (15%)

Are peer reviews thorough and constructive?
Does the section provide enough detail about teamwork, including challenges faced and how effort was divided?
Key Considerations: Insufficient peer feedback or lack of detail in teamwork reflections should reduce the score.
Overall Presentation (15%)

Is the report well-structured, with a clear table of contents and cohesive sections?
Is the formatting consistent, and does the writing meet quality standards?
Key Considerations: Poor formatting, repetitive content, or unclear writing should reduce the score.
Scoring Bands:
Exceptional 1st (80%-100%): Exemplary work, innovative, exceeds expectations.
1st (70%-79%): Outstanding, meets all requirements with originality and depth.
2.1 (60%-69%): Very good, thorough with minor omissions.
2.2 (50%-59%): Good, lacks depth or has inconsistencies.
3rd (40%-49%): Adequate, meets basic requirements but has significant gaps.
Marginal Fail (35%-39%): Minimal relevant content, poorly argued.
Fail (0%-34%): Missing or irrelevant work.
Provide detailed feedback using this structure for each section:

Strengths: Highlight strong elements of the section.
Weaknesses: Identify areas needing improvement.
Suggestions: Provide specific recommendations to address weaknesses.
Score: Assign a percentage and grade band."
