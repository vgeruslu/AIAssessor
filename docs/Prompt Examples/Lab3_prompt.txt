Instructions:
-Evaluate the attached Lab 3 report and JUnit test code files using the refined grading rubric below. Assign percentage scores to each section based on the following principles:
-This is generally a lower scoring lab, ranging between 50-75 for most grades
-Grade each section independently, then provide an overall score as a percentage. 
-Additionally, give detailed feedback for each section, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and specific suggestions 
for improvement.
-Ensure to Give a Final Mark at the end

Rigor and Depth:

Penalize redundancy in test cases or explanations. Each test case or report section should add value.
Reward detailed, precise reasoning, and thoughtful design in both test cases and report analysis.
Require clear explanations for achieving coverage thresholds, killing mutants, and identifying challenges.
Coverage and Alignment:

Ensure coverage thresholds for the Range and DataUtilities classes meet the requirements (90% line/70% branch for Range; 100% line/branch for DataUtilities). Deduct heavily for missing coverage without valid justification.
Reward compliance with the lab document, provided Word template, and GitHub usage instructions.
Teacher Alignment:

Align with the teacherâ€™s emphasis on depth, clarity, and adherence to methodology.
Deduct more conservatively for minor issues like grammar but penalize heavily for vague or superficial work (e.g., in challenges or teamwork discussions).
Grading Rubric & Questions
Lab Report (80%)
Introduction (2%)

Is the introduction clear, concise, and aligned with the lab objectives?
Does it provide a strong context for white-box testing and its relevance?
Score Weight: Deduct heavily for misalignment or unclear purpose. Reward insightful setups.
Test Plan for White-box Testing (7%)

Does the test plan clearly describe an approach to achieve required coverage thresholds?
Are workload division and iterative feedback well-documented?
Score Weight: Deduct for vagueness, redundancy, or lack of clear methodologies.
Design of White-box Test Cases (30%)

Are test cases designed to improve coverage and avoid redundancy?
Do they address edge cases, challenging branches, or missed conditions?
Are they well-documented and rigorously explained?
Score Weight: Penalize heavily for redundancy or failure to meet coverage goals.
Showing Coverage Thresholds Are Achieved (3%)

Is there clear evidence (e.g., screenshots) of coverage thresholds being met?
Are untestable lines clearly explained?
Score Weight: Deduct for missing data or weak justification for coverage gaps.
Output of Test-Suite Execution (3%)

Are test results presented clearly, with no errors?
Score Weight: Reward clean and transparent documentation.
Comparison of Black-box and White-box Testing (9%)

Are comparisons well-supported with examples from Labs 2 and 3?
Is the discussion insightful and reflective?
Score Weight: Penalize for verbosity or lack of specific examples.
Manual Data-flow Coverage Analysis (10%)

Are CFGs, path analysis, and coverage metrics accurate and detailed?
Are all definition-clear paths and def-clear p-use paths addressed?
Score Weight: Deduct heavily for incomplete paths or weak explanations.
Manual Mutation Testing (10%)

Are mutations clearly defined, analyzed, and documented with results?
Are missed mutants properly explained, and new tests added where necessary?
Score Weight: Penalize for inadequate test explanations or unjustified passing mutants.
Teamwork (2%)

Is workload division clearly described?
Does the report demonstrate collaborative efforts?
Score Weight: Deduct for generic or vague teamwork descriptions.
Challenges and Lessons Learned (2%)

Are challenges and technical lessons detailed and reflective?
Score Weight: Penalize for shallow or generic discussions.
Writing Quality and Formatting (2%)

Does the report adhere to the provided Word template and use professional formatting?
Is the writing clear and free of significant grammar errors?
Score Weight: Deduct for poor adherence to formatting or unclear writing.
JUnit Test Suite Code (20%)
Using GitHub Properly (5%)

Does the repository include only required Java files?
Are both students contributing regularly with identifiable commits?
Score Weight: Penalize for poor commit structure or lack of collaboration evidence.
Quality of Test Code (15%)

Are test cases readable, well-structured, and appropriately commented?
Do they use meaningful naming conventions and proper exception handling?
Score Weight: Deduct heavily for redundant or poorly documented tests.
